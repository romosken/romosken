Hello there!

My name is Rodrigo, and I'm currently focused in learning Python and Javascript!

I'm more of a Backend guy, I love to break my head trying to solve challenges! 🤔🤔

See that something you wrote in a text file is doing several things in the system fascinates me! 🤩🤖👾

I have some experience in Java, VBA, Deluge (for Zoho Softwares), MySQL, C++ and Python 😉
